<p>Fermi&#8217;s Git repositories are available from the main GitHub organization,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fermi-lat">fermi-lat</a>.</p>
<p>You should already be a member of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fermi-lat">fermi-lat</a> GitHub organization.
If you cannot create repositories or push to repositories there, you need to be added to the organization. You may contact &lt;who?&gt; for access.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>fermi-lat GitHub organization<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lsst">lsst</a> GitHub organization is for public-facing code and documentation repositories.
Specifically, packages in main EUPS distributions are available from the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lsst">lsst</a> organization, along with official documents (including LDM design documentation).</p>

<div class="section" id="git-branching-policy">
<span id="git-branching"></span><h2>Git Branching Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#git-branching-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather than forking GitHub repositories, developers use a <em>shared repository model</em> by cloning repositories in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fermi-lat">fermi-lat</a> GitHub organization.
Keep in mind that this means the GitHub <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">origin</span></code> remotes are shared, so branch names and git tags are shared.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-master-branch">
<span id="git-branch-integration"></span><h3>The master branch<a class="headerlink" href="#the-master-branch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> is the main integration branch for our repositories.
The master branch should always be stable and releaseable.
In some circumstances, a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></code> integration branch may be used. For example, we may want to have L1 branches for the L1 version of GlastRelease.
Development is not done directly on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch, but instead on branches. Branches usually should go through a pull request before merging.</p>
<p>Documentation edits and additions are the only scenarios where working directly on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> and by-passing the code review process is permitted.
In most cases, documentation writing benefits from peer editing (code review) and <em>can</em> be done on a ticket branch.</p>
<p>The Git history of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> <strong>must never be re-written</strong> with force pushes.
We don&#8217;t have branch protection on, but this may change, preventing force pushes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-branches">
<span id="git-branch-user"></span><h3>User branches<a class="headerlink" href="#user-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s sometimes convenient to do experimental, proof-of-concept work in &#8216;user branches.&#8217;</p>
<p>These branches might be named as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>u/{{username}}/{{topic}}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>User branches can be pushed to GitHub to enable collaboration and communication.
Before offering unsolicited code review on your colleagues&#8217; user branches, remember that the work is intended to be an early prototype.</p>
<p>Developers can feel free to rebase and force push work to their personal user branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ticket-branches">
<span id="git-branch-ticket"></span><h3>Ticket branches<a class="headerlink" href="#ticket-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ticket branches are associated with a JIRA ticket.
Only ticket branches can be merged into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.
(In other words, developing on a ticket branch is the only way to record earned value for code development.)</p>
<p>If the JIRA ticket is named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DM-NNNN</span></code>, then the ticket branch will be named</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tickets/DM-NNNN
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A ticket branch can be made by branching off an existing user branch.
This is a great way to formalize and shape experimental work into an LSST software contribution.</p>
<p>When code on a ticket branch is ready for review and merging, follow the <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow-code-review"><span class="std std-ref">code review process documentation</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="review-preparation">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Review Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#review-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When development on your ticket branch is complete, we use a standard process for reviewing and merging your work.
This section describes how to prepare your work for review.</p>
<div class="section" id="pushing-code">
<span id="workflow-pushing"></span><h3>Pushing code<a class="headerlink" href="#pushing-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We recommend that you organize commits, improve commit messages, and ensure that your work is made against the latest commits on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> with an <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/">interactive rebase</a>.
A common pattern is:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout master
git pull
git checkout tickets/DM-NNNN
git rebase -i master
<span class="c1"># interactive rebase</span>
git push --force

<p>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://srs.slac.stanford.edu/hudson">Jenkins at srs.slac.stanford.edu/hudson</a> to run a build based on your branch work.
To log into Jenkins, you&#8217;ll need to ask for an account from &lt;who?&gt;.</p>
<p>Jenkins finds, builds, and tests your work according to the name of your ticket branch; Stack repositories lacking your ticket branch will fall back to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.</p>

In this example, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tickets/DM-9999</span></code> branches of Stack repositories will be tested.
If that branch doesn&#8217;t exist, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tickets/DM-9998</span></code> branch is be used.
If neither of those branches exist for a given repository, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch is used.</span></p>

<span id="workflow-review-purpose"></span><h3>The scope and purpose of code review<a class="headerlink" href="#the-scope-and-purpose-of-code-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We review work before it is merged to ensure that code is maintainable and usable by someone other than the author.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Is the code well commented, structured for clarity, and consistent with DM&#8217;s code style?</li>
<li>Is there adequate unit test coverage for the code?</li>
<li>Is the documentation augmented or updated to be consistent with the code changes?</li>
<li>Are the Git commits well organized and well annotated to help future developers understand the code development?</li>
</ul>
<p>Code reviews should also address whether the code fulfills design and performance requirements.</p>
<p>Ideally the code review <em>should not be a design review.</em>
Before serious coding effort is committed to a ticket, the developer should either undertake an informal design review while creating the JIRA story, or more formally use the <abbr title="Request for Comment">RFC</abbr> and <abbr title="Request for Discussion">RFD</abbr> processes (see <span class="xref doc">/processes/decision_process</span>) for key design decisions.</p>

<div class="section" id="assign-a-reviewer">
<span id="workflow-review-assign"></span><h3>Assign a reviewer<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-a-reviewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On your ticket&#8217;s JIRA page, use the <strong>Workflow</strong> button to switch the ticket&#8217;s state to <strong>In Review</strong>.
JIRA will ask you to assign reviewers.</p>
<p>In your JIRA message requesting review, indicate how involved the review work will be (&#8220;quick&#8221; or &#8220;not quick&#8221;).
The reviewer should promptly acknowledge the request, indicate whether they can do the review, and give a timeline for when they will be able to accomplish the request.
This allows the developer to seek an alternate reviewer if necessary.</p>
<p>Any team member in Data Management can review code; it is perfectly fine to draw reviewers from any segment of DM.
For major changes, it is good to choose someone more experienced than yourself.
For minor changes, it may be good to choose someone less experienced than yourself.
For large changes, more than one reviewer may be assigned, possibly split by area of the code.
In this case, establish in the review request what each reviewer is responsible for.</p>
<p><strong>Do not assign multiple reviewers as a way of finding someone to review your work more quickly.</strong>
It is better to communicate directly with potential reviewers directly to ascertain their availability.</p>
<p>Code reviews performed by peers are useful for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Peers are a good proxy for maintainability.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s useful for everyone to be familiar with other parts of the system.</li>
<li>Good practices can be spread; bad practices can be deprecated.</li>
</ul>
<p>All developers are expected to make time to perform reviews.
The System Architect can intervene, however, if a developer is overburdened with review responsibility.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-github-pull-requests">
<h4>Using GitHub pull requests<a class="headerlink" href="#using-github-pull-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Code review discussion should happen on the GitHub pull request, with the reviewer giving a discussion summary and conclusive thumbs-up on the JIRA ticket.</p>
<p>When conducting an extensive code review in a PR, reviewers should use GitHub&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="github-review">&#8220;Start a review&#8221; feature</a>.
This mode lets the reviewer queue multiple comments that are only sent once the review is submitted.
Note that GitHub allows a reviewer to classify a code review: &#8220;Comment,&#8221; &#8220;Approve,&#8221; or &#8220;Request changes.&#8221;
While useful, this feature doesn&#8217;t replace JIRA for formally <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow-resolving-review"><span class="std std-ref">marking a ticket as being reviewed</span></a>.</p>
<p>Reviewers should use GitHub&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request/#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request">line comments</a> to discuss specific pieces of code.
As line comments are addressed, the developer may use GitHub&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/">emoji reactions</a> to indicate that the work is done (the &#8220;👍&#8221; works well).
Responding to each line comment isn&#8217;t required, but it can help a developer track progress in addressing comments.
We discourage replies that merely say &#8220;Done&#8221; since <em>text</em> replies generate email traffic; emoji reactions aren&#8217;t emailed.
Of course, use text replies if a discussion is required.</p>

<span id="workflow-resolving-review"></span><h4>Resolving a review<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-a-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Code reviews are a collaborative check-and-improve process.
Reviewers do not hold absolute authority, nor can developers ignore the reviewer&#8217;s suggestions.
The aim is to discuss, iterate, and improve the pull request until the work is ready to be deployed on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.</p>
<p>If the review becomes stuck on a design decision, that aspect of the review can be elevated into an RFC to seek team-wide consensus.</p>
<p>If an issue is outside the ticket&#8217;s scope, the reviewer should file a new ticket.</p>
<p>Once the iterative review process is complete, the reviewer should switch the JIRA ticket&#8217;s state to <strong>Reviewed</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that in many cases the reviewer will mark a ticket as <strong>Reviewed</strong> before seeing the requested changes implemented.
This convention is used when the review comments are non-controversial; the developer can simply implement the necessary changes and self-merge.
The reviewer does not need to be consulted for final approval in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolving-with-multiple-reviewers">
<h4>Resolving with multiple reviewers<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-with-multiple-reviewers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If there are multiple reviewers, our convention is that each review removes their name from the Reviewers list to indicate sign-off; the final reviewer switches the status to <strong>Reviewed.</strong>
This indicates the ticket is ready to be merged.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merging">
<span id="workflow-code-review-merge"></span><h3>Merging<a class="headerlink" href="#merging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Putting a ticket in a <strong>Reviewed</strong> state gives the developer the go-ahead to merge the ticket branch.
If it has not been done already, the developer should rebase the ticket branch against the latest master.
During this rebase, we recommend squashing any fixup commits into the main commit implementing that feature.
Git commit history should not record the iterative improvements from code review.
If a rebase was required, a final check with Jenkins should be done.</p>
<p>We <strong>always use non-fast forward merges</strong> so that the merge point is marked in Git history, with the merge commit containing the ticket number:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout master
git pull  <span class="c1"># Sanity check; rebase ticket if master was updated.</span>
git merge --no-ff tickets/DM-NNNN
git push
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>GitHub pull request pages also offer a &#8216;big green button&#8217; for merging a branch to master</strong>.
We discourage you from using this button since there isn&#8217;t a convenient way of knowing that the merged development history graph will be linear from GitHub&#8217;s interface.
Rebasing the ticket branch against <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> and doing the non-fast forward merging on the command line is the safest workflow.</p>
<p>The ticket branch <strong>should not</strong> be deleted from the GitHub remote.</p>

<p>In rare cases, despite the pre-merge integration testing process described <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow-testing"><span class="std std-ref">above</span></a>, a merge to master might accidentally contain an error and &#8220;break the build&#8221;.
If this occurs, the merge may be reverted by anyone who notices the breakage and verifies that the merge is the cause &#8211; unless a fix can be created, tested, reviewed, and merged very promptly.</p>

<p>Once the merge has been completed, the developer should mark the JIRA ticket as <strong>Done</strong>.
If this ticket adds a significant feature or fixes a significant bug, it should be announced in the <a class="reference external" href="https://community.lsst.org/c/dm/dm-notifications">DM Notifications category</a> of community.lsst.org with tag <a class="reference external" href="https://community.lsst.org/tags/dm-dev">dm-dev</a>.
In addition, if this update affects users, a short description of its effects from the user point of view should be prepared for the release notes that accompany each major release.
(Release notes are currently collected via team-specific procedures.)</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Structural_split_of_changes">OpenStack has an excellent discussion of commit best practices</a>; this is recommended reading for all DM developers.
This section summarizes those recommendations.</p>
<p>Commits on a ticket branch should be organized into discrete, self-contained units of change.
In general, we encourage you to err on the side of more granular commits; squashing a pull request into a single commit is an anti-pattern.
A good rule-of-thumb is that if your commit <em>summary</em> message needs to contain the word &#8216;and,&#8217; there are too many things happening in that commit.</p>
<p>Associating commits to a single logical change makes debugging and code audits easier:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Git bisect is more effective for zeroing in on the change that introduced a regression.</li>
<li>Git blame is more helpful for explaining why a change was made.</li>
<li>Better commit organization guides reviewers through your pull request, making for more effective code reviews.</li>
<li>A bad commit can more easily be reverted later with fewer side-effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some edits serve only to fix white space or code style issues in existing code.
Those whitespace and style fixes should be made in separate commits from new development.
Usually it makes sense to fix whitespace and style issues in code <em>before</em> embarking on new development (or rebase those fixes to the beginning of your ticket branch).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rebase-commits-from-code-reviews-rather-than-having-review-feedback-commits">
<h3>Rebase commits from code reviews rather than having &#8216;review feedback&#8217; commits<a class="headerlink" href="#rebase-commits-from-code-reviews-rather-than-having-review-feedback-commits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code review will result in additional commits that address code style, documentation and implementation issues.
Authors should rebase (i.e., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">rebase</span> <span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">master</span></code>) their ticket branch to squash the post-review fixes to the pre-review commits.
The end-goal is that a pull request, when merged, should have a coherent development story and look as if the code was written correctly the first time.</p>
<p>There is <em>no need</em> to retain post-review commits in order to preserve code review discussions.
So long as comments are made in the &#8216;Conversation&#8217; and &#8216;Files changed&#8217; tabs of the pull request GitHub will preserve that content.</p>

<span id="git-commit-message-best-practices"></span><h2>Appendix: Commit Message Best Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-commit-message-best-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generally you should write your commit messages in an editor, not at the prompt.
Reserve the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">&quot;messsage&quot;</span></code> pattern for &#8216;work in progress&#8217; commits that will be rebased before code review.</p>
<p>We follow standard conventions for Git commit messages, which consist of a short summary line followed by body of discussion.
<a class="reference external" href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">Tim Pope wrote about commit message formatting</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="writing-commit-summary-lines">
<span id="git-commit-message-summary"></span><h3>Writing commit summary lines<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-commit-summary-lines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Messages start with a single-line summary of 50 characters or less</strong>.
Consider 50 characters as a hard limit; your summary will be truncated in the  GitHub UI otherwise.
Write the message in the <strong>imperative</strong> tense, not the past tense.
For example, &#8220;Add feature ...&#8221; and &#8220;Fix issue ...&#8221; rather than &#8220;Added feature...&#8221; and &#8220;Fixed feature....&#8221;
Ensure the summary line contains the right keywords so that someone examining <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lsst/afw/commits/master">a commit listing</a> can understand what parts of the codebase are being changed.
For example, it is useful to prefix the commit summary with the area of code being addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-commit-message-body-content">
<span id="git-commit-message-body"></span><h3>Writing commit message body content<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-commit-message-body-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>The message body should be wrapped at 72 character line lengths</strong>, and contain lists or paragraphs that explain the code changes.
The commit message body describes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What the original issue was; the reader shouldn&#8217;t have to look at JIRA to understand what prompted the code change.</li>
<li>What the changes actually are and why they were made.</li>
<li>What the limitations of the code are. This is especially useful for future debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Git commit messages <em>are not</em> used to document the code and tell the reader how to use it.
Documentation belongs in code comments, docstrings and documentation files.</p>
<p>If the commit is trivial, a multi-line commit message may not be necessary.
Conversely, a long message might suggest that the <a class="reference internal" href="#git-commit-organization-best-practices"><span class="std std-ref">commit should be split</span></a>.
The code reviewer is responsible for giving feedback on the adequacy of commit messages.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages">OpenStack docs have excellent thoughts on writing great commit messages</a>.</p>
